# 🧠 Deep Learning Implementation

This repository contains various deep learning projects and implementations created while learning and experimenting with neural networks, model training, and evaluation techniques using TensorFlow and Keras.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

The goal of this repository is to understand the **core concepts of deep learning** through hands-on implementation.  
Each project explores different topics such as:

- Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)
- Model training, validation, and overfitting
- Optimizers, activation functions, and loss minimization
- Performance evaluation and visualization (accuracy, loss)
- Dataset preprocessing and feature scaling
